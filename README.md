## Abstract
Algorithmic Governance OS is a theoretical framework describing how sovereignty, legitimacy, and political agency transform when decision-making shifts from human intention to computational optimization. Power is exercised not through deliberate political will but through automated processes that modulate attention, visibility, and exception. This repository contains a 24‑chapter manuscript, an interlude chapter on boundary conditions, and a set of conceptual modules outlining the operational logic of governance in the age of AI.

## Core Concepts

### Will-less Sovereignty
Sovereignty migrates from human decision-makers to algorithmic systems whose optimization functions act as a quasi-will. Power is exercised without intention, responsibility, or accountability.

### Quasi-will
Objective functions (engagement, retention, virality) behave like a non-conscious will, directing social behavior without possessing meaning, narrative, or moral horizon.

### Exception State OS
The boundaries of political visibility and invisibility are continuously redrawn by fluctuations in attention. Exception becomes an automated process rather than a sovereign decision.

### Algorithmic Chosenness
Visibility and relevance are determined by compatibility with optimization logic. Populations are amplified, neutralized, or abandoned based on statistical fit rather than merit, identity, or moral value.

### Attention Capitalism
Attention becomes the primary political resource. The modulation of attention flows constitutes a new form of sovereignty.

## Manuscript Structure (24 Chapters + Interlude)

### Interlude (between Chapters 8 and 9)
**Boundary Conditions of the Algorithmic Governance OS**  
A theoretical bridge examining exteriority, automated chosenness, and the limits of will-less sovereignty. This chapter connects the core modules (1–8) with the domain-specific extensions (9–24).

## Purpose
This repository functions as:
- a research platform for political theory in the age of AI  
- an open manuscript for academic publication  
- an operating-system-style specification of algorithmic governance  
- a public knowledge base for scholars, policymakers, and technologists  

It provides a conceptual toolkit for analyzing how sovereignty, legitimacy, and human agency are reconfigured by computational infrastructures.
