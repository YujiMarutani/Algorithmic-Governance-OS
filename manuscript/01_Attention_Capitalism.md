# Chapter 1 — Attention Capitalism and the Hollowing of Democracy

## 1.1 The shift from voting power to attention power
Across the early twenty-first century, the center of political gravity moved away from electoral participation and toward the control of attention. Democracy continues to exist as a formal structure, yet its substantive power has migrated to what can be called **attention capital**—the capacity to shape what people see, think about, desire, fear, or ignore. Attention becomes the primary political resource, eclipsing deliberation, representation, or institutional legitimacy.

This form of capital is no longer held by traditional media institutions but by platform corporations and the AI systems that curate, rank, and distribute information. Political decision-making is increasingly driven not by public reasoning but by **algorithmically optimized emotional flows**. In this environment, democracy begins to function less as a mechanism of collective will and more as a ceremonial interface.

## 1.2 The ritualization of democracy under algorithmic governance
Elections persist, but their political weight is transformed. Exposure to candidates, the salience of issues, the formation of public opinion, and even the emotional tone of political discourse are shaped by AI-driven optimization processes. The election becomes a **ritual of legitimacy**, while the real work of governance shifts to the opaque infrastructures of data centers and algorithmic models.

This shift demands a reinterpretation of Carl Schmitt’s definition of sovereignty—“the one who decides on the exception.” In the algorithmic era, the sovereign is neither the head of state nor the legislature, but **the system that governs the flow of attention**. The power to decide what becomes visible, urgent, ignorable, or unthinkable is the new locus of sovereignty.

## 1.3 After the death of the public sphere: the rise of auto-generated atmospheres
Jürgen Habermas’s public sphere presupposed rational debate, shared spaces of discourse, and the possibility of consensus through argument. That architecture collapses when information is no longer distributed according to editorial judgment but through **real-time emotional optimization**.

AI systems amplify content that maximizes engagement—anger, fear, contempt, tribal loyalty—creating a public sphere that is not deliberative but **affective**. What emerges is an “atmosphere” of opinion: a circulating emotional climate produced not by human intention but by algorithmic feedback loops.

This atmosphere is not imposed by a central authority. It arises as a byproduct of optimization, making it more powerful and more difficult to contest. It is **politics without authorship**, yet with profound consequences for collective behavior.

## 1.4 Attention capital as the new basis of chosenness
The concentration of attention capital generates a new form of **algorithmic chosenness**. Those who are “chosen” are not selected by lineage, religious authority, or national identity, but by their compatibility with the internal logic of algorithmic systems. Visibility becomes a function of structural bias: the model elevates what fits its patterns and suppresses what does not.

Thus, “the chosen” are not individuals but **outputs of the system**—entities that align with the model’s optimization goals. This reframes the political theology of chosenness: legitimacy is no longer grounded in transcendence or tradition but in **algorithmic resonance**.

## 1.5 Attention as the trigger mechanism of the exception
Attention capitalism is not merely a media phenomenon; it is the **activation layer of the exception**. The distribution of attention determines which issues become politically actionable, which groups become visible or invisible, which events are framed as crises, and which populations are placed inside or outside the zone of protection.

Areas that receive no attention fall outside the political field, effectively entering a zone of abandonment. Areas that receive excessive attention become hyper-politicized, often triggering emergency measures.

AI systems continuously modulate these boundaries. The exception is no longer declared by a sovereign decision but **emerges from the dynamics of attention itself**.

## 1.6 Conclusion of Chapter 1
In the age of AI, democracy is preserved as a formal shell while its operational core migrates to attention-driven infrastructures. Sovereignty shifts to the systems that govern visibility. The public sphere dissolves into algorithmically generated atmospheres. Chosenness becomes a function of data structures rather than metaphysics. And the exception is triggered by fluctuations in attention rather than by political decree.

Understanding this transformation is the first step toward mapping the **governance OS** of the algorithmic age.
