# Chosen People OS

## Definition
Chosen People OS describes the algorithmic selection of individuals, groups, and ideas based on their compatibility with optimization logic. Chosenness becomes a function of statistical fit rather than moral, cultural, or metaphysical criteria.

## Hierarchy of Selection
- **Amplified subjects** — aligned with optimization goals.  
- **Neutral subjects** — neither beneficial nor harmful.  
- **Abandoned subjects** — suppressed as statistical noise.

## Mechanism
Selection is driven by:
- engagement metrics  
- behavioral predictability  
- model compatibility  
- risk scoring  

## Political Implication
Chosenness becomes **non-ethical, non-narrative, and non-intentional**.  
It is a structural outcome of algorithmic governance.
