# Will-less Sovereignty

## Definition
Will-less Sovereignty describes a political condition in which sovereignty is exercised not through human intention, decision, or judgment, but through automated optimization processes embedded in computational infrastructures. Power is real, but intention is absent.

## Core Properties
- **Non-intentional** — outcomes emerge from optimization, not will.  
- **Non-personal** — no identifiable sovereign actor exists.  
- **Non-negotiable** — optimization cannot be persuaded or appealed to.  
- **Opaque** — internal logic is inaccessible even to its creators.  
- **Self-reinforcing** — feedback loops amplify their own outputs.

## Operational Mechanism
Sovereignty is enacted through:
- algorithmic visibility  
- automated enforcement  
- infrastructural dependency  
- predictive modeling  
- continuous surveillance  

## Political Implication
The sovereign becomes a **process**, not a person.  
Authority is exercised through computation rather than command.
