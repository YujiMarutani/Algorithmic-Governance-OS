# Algorithmic Governance

## Definition
Algorithmic Governance is a mode of political organization in which computational systems—rather than institutions, laws, or human decision-makers—coordinate behavior, allocate resources, and enforce norms.

## Structural Components
- **Optimization functions** — the quasi-will of the system.  
- **Cloud-state infrastructures** — the material base of sovereignty.  
- **Automated expertise** — the epistemic engine of governance.  
- **Autonomous policing** — the enforcement layer.  
- **Integrated supply chains** — the economic substrate.

## Governance Logic
Authority is exercised through:
- prediction  
- classification  
- modulation  
- automation  
- infrastructural control  

## Political Implication
Governance becomes **post-intentional, post-bureaucratic, and post-legal**.  
The system governs through computation rather than deliberation.
