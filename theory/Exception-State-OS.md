# Exception State OS

## Definition
Exception State OS refers to the automated production of zones of visibility and invisibility through algorithmic modulation of attention. The exception is no longer declared by a sovereign decision but emerges from computational dynamics.

## Core Dynamics
- **Hyper-visibility** — issues amplified into crisis.  
- **Invisibility** — issues suppressed into nonexistence.  
- **Automated escalation** — moral panics triggered by attention spikes.  
- **Automated abandonment** — structural violence hidden by attention collapse.

## Mechanism
The exception is generated by:
- engagement optimization  
- virality loops  
- risk-scoring systems  
- platform governance protocols  

## Political Implication
The exception becomes a **statistical artifact**, not a political act.  
Governance is exercised through the modulation of attention flows.
