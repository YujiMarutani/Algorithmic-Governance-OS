# Diagram Directory Overview

This directory contains the complete visual architecture of the *Algorithmic Governance OS*. All diagrams are organized into two complementary layers:

- **Architecture Layer** — core structural diagrams that define the OS itself.
- **Conceptual Layer** — diagrams that visualize the cognitive, institutional, and geopolitical tensions underlying the OS.

Together, these diagrams provide both a rigorous technical model and a broader theoretical context.

## Architecture Layer

The Architecture Layer consists of three diagrams that form the structural backbone of the OS. These diagrams define the system’s static architecture, module dependencies, and runtime behavior.

### 01_Architecture.png
A top-level overview of the OS structure, visualizing the three major strata:

- **Core Logic (Modules 1–8)** — the kernel of algorithmic governance  
- **Social Modules (Modules 9–20)** — domains where algorithmic intervention manifests  
- **Geopolitical Modules (Modules 21–24)** — long-term systemic outcomes

This diagram provides the foundational map of the entire OS.

### 02_Dependency_Graph.png
A dependency graph showing how the 24 modules relate to one another. It clarifies:

- Causal and functional dependencies  
- Cross-layer interactions  
- High-leverage hubs such as *Visibility Architecture* and *Automation of Expertise*

This diagram is essential for understanding how the OS coheres as a system.

### 03_Runtime_Flow.mmd / 03_Runtime_Flow.png
A dynamic model of how the OS operates at runtime, structured into five layers:

- **Input Layer**  
- **Core Logic Processing Pipeline**  
- **Social Intervention Layer**  
- **Output Layer**  
- **Geopolitical Convergence**

A feedback loop connects long-term geopolitical outcomes back to the system’s inputs, illustrating the OS’s recursive nature.

The `.mmd` file serves as the **source of truth**, ensuring reproducibility and consistent regeneration of the diagram.

## Conceptual Layer

The Conceptual Layer contains diagrams that illuminate the philosophical, cognitive, and institutional tensions that motivate and contextualize the OS. These diagrams do not define the OS’s structure directly but clarify the deeper forces shaping it.

### cognitive_conflict.png
Visualizes the tension between cognitive load, institutional demands, and individual agency. Shows how algorithmic systems reshape human decision-making environments.

### institutional_vs_sincerity.png
Illustrates the divergence between institutional logic and personal sincerity. Explores how automated governance transforms ethical and normative expectations.

### system_fracture_funnel.png
Depicts systemic failure modes, exception states, and points of fracture. Clarifies where and how the OS encounters limits or breakdown conditions.

### global_os_flowchart.png
A simplified, high-level overview of the OS’s three-layer structure (Core → Social → Geopolitical). Designed as an accessible entry point for readers encountering the theory for the first time.

## Directory Principles

This directory follows four guiding principles:

- **Reproducibility** — all structural diagrams are backed by `.mmd` source files or explicit structural definitions.  
- **Layered Clarity** — Architecture diagrams define the OS; conceptual diagrams illuminate its theoretical background.  
- **Extensibility** — the structure accommodates future additions such as exception-handling flows or multi-agent runtime models.  
- **Transparency** — external researchers can regenerate diagrams and trace the system logic without ambiguity.

## Planned Additions

- Finalized **03_Runtime_Flow.png** generated from the `.mmd` source  
- A unified **Full Convergence Diagram** integrating Architecture + Dependency + Runtime  
- Optional module-level micro-diagrams for each of the 24 components
